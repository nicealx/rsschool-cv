## About me ##
The goal is to reach the level of a developer, because I have been working in the topic for more than 6 years, but I still only do all sorts of small freelance work. Recently I created my first website for a sum that was not bad for me (considering that I only did minor work). I work as a freelancer, mainly with WordPress and pure html-css-js. As of October 21, 2023, for the third month now, Iâ€™ve been sitting on the freelance platform every day and doing something, but I want more, to be more expensive as a specialist.

## Code Example ##

**Sum of Digits / Digital Root KATA from CodeWars:**
Digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number.
Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has more than one digit, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. The input will be a non-negative integer.
```
function digitalRoot(n) {
  while (String(n).length > 1) {
    n = String(n).split("").reduce((sum, num) => Number(sum) + Number(num));
  }

  return Number(n);
}
```
